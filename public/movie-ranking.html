<h1>The Best Movies According to Yazan</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of last-year.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Black Adam</h3>
<p>the spiky and majestic "Black Adam" is one of the best DC superhero films to date</p>
<h3>The Lion King</h3>
<p>a childhood-shaping, Oscar-winning blockbuster, the second-highest grossing feature film of its calendar year, one of the last great hand-drawn Disney animated features</p>
<h3>Mowgli Legend Of The Jungle</h3>
<p>somewhere between a film that's for kids and yet, in its persistent cruelty and bleakness, definitely not for kids.<br />
     The whole movie feels oddly stranded and dramatically inert, despite the obvious passion that went into making it.</p>
